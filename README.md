Here's the workflow I recommend while analyzing papers using the "co-op" folder:
_ Learn what a suitable paper for this analysis contains: Go to "docs/Finding a paper". Read the newest version. 
_ Once you've read the paper & determined that it's useful, download the paper (in PDF) to papers_toAnalyze. Naming convention is 1st author's last name followed by year e.g. Tenaillon2016.
_ Download the data to "data_in/to_analyze", keeping the data in a folder named identically with its paper (AuthorYear).
_ The data file as downloaded should be named "AuthorYear_original".
_ Do some data cleaning in Excel. Once done, save-as the data in .csv format ("CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)") & name the new file "AuthorYear_usable".
