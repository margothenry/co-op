# Future updates for v3:
## Combine with things from "finding a paper - v2".
## Finish the "Under construction" section.
## Add image for the "Manipulated dataset" section in the Wannier example.
## Change tab title.
## Look at the different options for "theme".
## Look into ways of customizing the floating table of contents - current version expands/collapses too fast, move toc_float further to the left.
